# Compromise.cpp

###### A simple game interface to be used in machine learning teaching

A python version of the game can be found [here](https://github.com/gmoutsin/Compromise)
and a web implementation of the game can be found [here](https://gmoutsin.github.io/compromise/game).

The interface provides three libraries, `ComGameTypes`, `Players` and `ComGame`. Any player class must extend the class `AbstractPlayer` and implement two functions `move` and `place`. See the documentation for more information.

The documentation can be generated by Doxygen.

## Building

There are two scripts provided to build the interface, `build.sh` and `build.bat`, for linux and windows respectively.
The scripts build everything in a new directory, `build`.
After they are built the header and library files are moved into `include` and `lib` folders respectively
and the `build` folder is deleted.

##### Note

The windows build script uses the MinGW generator for cmake. If you are using a different one
make sure to update it.
